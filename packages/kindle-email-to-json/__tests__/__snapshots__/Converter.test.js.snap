If you were living in a world with scarce food and working hard to chase after your calories, fat would be a huge win. So, yes—it makes sense to love grease, to love salt, to love sweet; they’re the trifecta of survival in a world where finding food meant hunting and foraging.",

Salt is not unhealthy unless you get too much, and you need some to live; same with fat.

If we think in terms of adaptation, evolutionary biology, and survival with limited food sources, women who had stored fat were more likely to have bodies capable of reproduction. When women’s body fat falls below a particular threshold, it’s common for them to become amenorrheic (i.e., stop having their period). That’s adaptive. Essentially, women can’t become pregnant when they don’t have a sufficient amount of energy reserve available. Related to that, the range of body fat that is healthy for women is about twice the level that’s healthy for men.",

Women tend to gain weight in the pear/ gynoid pattern—in the hips, thighs, buttocks, and legs—which is less associated with health problems because it has lower negative metabolic effects. As a rule, fat stored in the lower extremities doesn’t tend to drive up blood pressure or lipids, cause insulin resistance, or infiltrate vital organs like the liver.",

If you then go off the diet and gain weight back, unless you work out like a fiend, you’ll gain back mostly fat. With each of those cycles you shift your body composition more and more toward a higher fat percentage, which is a less metabolically efficient machine. Fat requires fewer calories to maintain its size than muscle does. So essentially, you create a pathway by which you need fewer calories each time to maintain fat and require ever more severe calorie restriction to lose it.",

    In fact, there was not even an attempt to stick to one version of Linux.=

    the key practice for managers within these companies is that they try no=
t to let their own biases and judgments play too large a role in determining=
 which of the ideas they hear are the good ones, and thus worthy of implemen=
tation. Instead, they fall back whenever possible on the processes of iterat=
ion and experimentation to find unbiased evidence on the quality of a new id=
ea. Managers, in other words, step away from their traditional roles as eval=
uators and gatekeepers of ideas. This shift is uncomfortable for some, who f=
ear (with justification) that some bad ideas will see the light of day, but m=
any of the most impressive companies and managers we=E2=80=99ve encountered b=
elieve the benefits are far greater than the risks.

<div class=3D"noteText">
    companies will also exist for a much more important reason: they are one=
 of the best ways we=E2=80=99ve ever come up with to get big things done in t=
he world. To feed people and improve their health; to provide entertainment a=
nd access to knowledge; to improve material conditions of life and to do so f=
or more and more people over time, all around the planet. The new technologi=
es of the crowd will help greatly with all this, but they will not displace c=
ompanies, which are one of the cornerstone technologies of the core.

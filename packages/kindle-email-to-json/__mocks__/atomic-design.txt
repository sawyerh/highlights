    The earliest cars and components were individually crafted, which led to=
 many safety and maintainability nightmares. Ford broke the automobile down i=

    I recently visited my health insurance provider=E2=80=99s website to pay=
 my bill. In the course of five clicks, I was hit with four distinct interfa=
ce designs, some of which looked like they were last touched in 1999. This i=
nconsistent experience put the burden on me, the user, to figure out what we=
nt where and how to interpret disparate interface elements. By the time I go=
t to the payment form, I felt like I couldn=E2=80=99t trust the company to s=
uccessfully and securely process my payment. Style guides help iron out thes=

    atoms of our interfaces serve as the foundational building blocks that c=
omprise all our user interfaces. These atoms include basic HTML elements lik=
e form labels, inputs, buttons, and others that can=E2=80=99t be broken down=
 any further without ceasing to be functional.

    molecules are relatively simple groups of UI elements functioning togeth=

    Creating simple components helps UI designers and developers adhere to t=

 encourages a =E2=80=9Cdo one thing and do it well=E2=80=9D mentality. Burde=
ning a single pattern with too much complexity makes software unwieldy. Ther=
efore, creating simple UI molecules makes testing easier, encourages reusabi=

    To sum up atomic design in a nutshell: Atoms are UI elements that can=E2=

s of an interface. Molecules are collections of atoms that form relatively s=
imple UI components. Organisms are relatively complex components that form d=
iscrete sections of an interface. Templates place components within a layout=
 and demonstrate the design=E2=80=99s underlying content structure. Pages ap=
ply real content to templates and articulate variations to demonstrate the f=
inal UI and test the resilience of the design system.

    In his book =C2=A0The Shape of Design, Frank Chimero beautifully articul=
ates the power this traversal provides: The painter, when at a distance from=
 the easel, can assess and analyze the whole of the work from this vantage. H=
e scrutinizes and listens, chooses the next stroke to make, then approaches t=
he canvas to do it. Then, he steps back again to see what he=E2=80=99s done i=
n relation to the whole. It is a dance of switching contexts, a pitter-patte=
r pacing across the studio floor that produces a tight feedback loop between=
 mark-making and mark-assessing. Frank Chimero Atomic design lets us dance b=
etween contexts like the painter Frank so eloquently describes. The atoms, m=
olecules, and organisms that comprise our interfaces do not live in a vacuum=
. And our interfaces=E2=80=99 templates and pages are indeed composed of sma=
ller parts. The parts of our designs influence the whole, and the whole infl=
uences the parts. The two are intertwined, and atomic design embraces this f=
act.

    Style tiles (along with their in-browser counterparts, style prototypes)=

    Let=E2=80=99s quickly review what establishing design direction looks li=

 initial design directions. Frontend developers can set up project dependenc=

    Working in the browser allows teams to address layout issues across the e=
ntire resolution spectrum, design around dynamic data (such as variable char=
acter lengths, image sizes, and other dynamic content), demonstrate interact=
ion and animation, gauge performance, factor in ergonomics, and confront tec=
hnical considerations (such as pixel density, text rendering, scrolling perf=
ormance, and browser quirks). Static design comps cannot deal with all these=
 considerations, so they should be treated merely as hypotheses rather than s=
et-in-stone specifications. Only when transferred to the browser can any des=
ign hypothesis truly be confirmed or rejected.

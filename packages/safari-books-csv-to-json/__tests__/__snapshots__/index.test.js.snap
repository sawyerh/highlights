You derive a fit criterion by examining the requirement’s description and rationale, and determining which quantification best expresses the user’s intention for the requirement. You may sometimes find that this close examination results in changes to the requirement, but these changes are for the better and should be considered quite normal; their occurrence simply means the requirement was not properly understood in the first instance.",

Alternatively, they may state a requirement that is so vague as to be (for the moment) unusable.

Solutions lock you into one technology or another, and whatever is chosen may be out of date by the time the product is built.

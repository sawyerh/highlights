You derive a fit criterion by examining the requirement’s description and rationale, and determining which quantification best expresses the user’s intention for the requirement. You may sometimes find that this close examination results in changes to the requirement, but these changes are for the better and should be considered quite normal; their occurrence simply means the requirement was not properly understood in the first instance.",

The description you write is the stakeholder’s way of stating the intention of the requirement. If your stakeholders are like most of us, they speak using everyday language, which is, unfortunately, often ambiguous and often not precise enough. You need to clarify the requirement with a fit criterion that is stated in unambiguous, precise terms and probably uses numbers or a measurement to convey its meaning.",

The fit criterion specifies how you will know that the product has successfully carried out that action. For functional requirements, there are no scales of measurement: The action is either completed or not completed. Completion depends on satisfying an authority that the product has correctly performed the action. The authority in this case is either the source of the data or the adjacent system that initiated the action.",

We have found that attaching a rationale to the requirement makes it far easier to understand the real need. Quite often, stakeholders may tell you their perceived solution to the problem, rather than their real need. Alternatively, they may state a requirement that is so vague as to be (for the moment) unusable. In the example given previously, the client asked for a “user-friendly” product, but you could make sense of it when you learned that the rationale was that the project needed the users to readily adopt the product.",

Solutions lock you into one technology or another, and whatever is chosen may be out of date by the time the product is built.

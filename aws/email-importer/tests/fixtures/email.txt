    the key practice for managers within these companies is that they try no=
t to let their own biases and judgments play too large a role in determining=
 which of the ideas they hear are the good ones, and thus worthy of implemen=
tation. Instead, they fall back whenever possible on the processes of iterat=
ion and experimentation to find unbiased evidence on the quality of a new id=
ea. Managers, in other words, step away from their traditional roles as eval=
